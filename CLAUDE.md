# Parallel Code

Electron desktop app — SolidJS frontend, Node.js backend. Published for **macOS and Linux only** (no Windows).

## Stack

- **Frontend:** SolidJS, TypeScript (strict), Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js (Electron, node-pty)
- **Package manager:** npm

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start Electron app in dev mode
- `npm run build` — build production Electron app
- `npm run typecheck` — run TypeScript type checking

## Project Structure

- `src/` — SolidJS frontend (components, store, IPC, lib)
- `src/lib/` — frontend utilities (IPC wrappers, window management, drag, zoom)
- `electron/` — Electron main process (IPC handlers, preload)
- `electron/ipc/` — backend IPC handlers (pty, git, tasks, persistence)
- `src/store/` — app state management

## Conventions

- Functional components only (SolidJS signals/stores, no classes)
- Electron IPC for all frontend-backend communication
- IPC channel names defined in `electron/ipc/channels.ts` (shared enum)
- `strict: true` TypeScript, no `any`

## Agent Rules

- NEVER push to origin or any remote
- NEVER commit directly to main or master
- NEVER force push
- Work only on the branch you were given
- Do not install new dependencies without asking
- Do not delete files unless explicitly told to
- Keep changes focused — only modify what is needed for the task
